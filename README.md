Training NN-models to transit text to handwriten characters via EMNIST dataset

In this work, I glad to introduce convolutional conditional variational autoencoder for you. It can transit text to image with handwriten characters. Models were training on EMNIST dataset (link: https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset).

The Jupiter Page has 9 section:

1.Libraries import

2.Data downloading

3.CVAE creation

4.Training

5.Testing

6.Models saving

7.Loading models

8.Text to images

9.Visualisation

I hope you'll find my work interesting.

Thanks,
Dmity Utev.
